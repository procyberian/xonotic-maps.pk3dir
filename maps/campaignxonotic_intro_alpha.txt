"dm","red-planet","3","2","15",,,"DM: Red Planet","Welcome to Xonotic!\nWe'll start off easy with Deathmatch against 3 beginner bots on Red Planet. Xonotic is mainly a multiplayer game, but before jumping into online games it can be a good idea to practice a bit against bots. After finishing the campaign you should be set for online play, either on special beginners-only servers or regular servers, that's up to you. :)"
"tdm","stormkeep","3","4",,"5",,"TDM: Stormkeep","Next we'll try some 2on2 Team Deathmatch on Stormkeep.\nYou'll have to do your best for five minutes, because the team with the highest score after this time limit will be the winning team! The opponents are also slightly more difficult now. Don't let the warpzone get you lost!"
"dm","glowplant","1","6",,"5",,"1v1 Duel: Glowplant","Now it's time for you to show what you've learnt so far!\nIn a duel, it is important to collect and control items, especially the bigger powerups such as the Mega Health. They all spawn at regular intervals, learning to time them is the key... This is a five minute match, the player who ends up with the highest score wins."
"ctf","dance","5","8","3",,,"CTF: Dance","By now you are expected to know the basics so let's try something entirely new, namely Capture the Flag! In CTF you're supposed to bring the enemy flag to your own base, but that's not enough: both flags have to be in your base for a successful capture. First team to reach three flag captures wins."
"ctf","space-elevator","5","11","3",,,"CTF: Space Elevator","More CTF!\nThis map is way more open than Dance, it is a space floater after all. Be careful not to fall down! Use the launchpads to your advantage to get up to huge speeds quick. Same story as before, three caps to win."
"dm","g-23","3","14",,"10",,"DM: G-23","Let's end this with a real challenge!\nYou'll face three Godlike bots in a 10-minute Deathmatch on the G-23 docking station. Can you prove that you are the best?
